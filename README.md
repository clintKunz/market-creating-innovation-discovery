# market-creating-innovation-discovery
A methodology to discover market-creating innovations around the globe

## Here are some ideas I have for non-consumption in the US
- There are many who do not get mental health services but could use it
- There are many who borrow money from relatives, but they don't use a tool to help with this sensitive exchange
- There are many who do not eat healthy because a lack of skill in preparation, lack of time, lack of access to healthy meals, and lack of money

## There has to be a research methodology that undercovers market-creating innovations
Random thoughts
- It's difficult to find market-creating innovation because of it's less-than-exciting nature; hence, little reporting on the micro instances
- market-creating innovation takes time and is generally patient with growth
- market-creating innovation is seen as 'not a good idea' at first because of its lack of data to predict ROI
